# Documentation Index

Use this directory for living specifications and reference material that evolve with the project.

- `architecture.md` — system topology, deployment, and key data flows.
- `hashing-spec.md` — deterministic hashing and frame serialization details.
- `api-contract.md` — backend endpoints, request/response schemas, and error surfaces.

When you update protocols or endpoints, keep these docs in sync with the implementation.
